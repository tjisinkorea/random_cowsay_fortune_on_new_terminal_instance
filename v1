# I wouldn't put this up, but as a Linux newbie, it took me a lot of digging from different sources to get the whole set up done, 
so I'm sharing how to do this quickly.

$ sudo apt-get install cowsay
$ sudo apt install fortune-mod
$ fortune | cowsay

# Lastly, to make cowsay load on each new terminal instance with a random fortune and random animal, go to 
.bashrc file and the very bottom type the following

$ fortune | cowsay -f `ls /usr/share/cowsay/cows/ | shuf -n 1`

# exit the terminal and each time you open a new instance you will have your animal telling you a fortune. 

# I wasn't able to get the .bashrc script to run on new terminal instances on Kali although the script worked in the terminal.
